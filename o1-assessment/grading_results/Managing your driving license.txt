Below is an example of how one might grade the “submission” that is actually just the driver‐license document (Document 2) rather than a genuine gearbox design report.  Because none of the required gearbox‐project sections appear in Document 2, each rubric item is treated as “empty/missing,” which per the grading scheme corresponds to a score of –5 (i.e., –100 percent for that section).

TOTAL MARK ACHIEVED FOR DOCUMENT 2: 0%

Explanation:

• Each required gearbox‐report section is effectively “missing.” According to the rubric, missing sections merit a –5 score (i.e., –100 percent of that particular section’s weighting).

• Because none of the required structure, calculations, or references to gears/shafts/ratios appeared in the driver’s‐license document (Document 2), the net effect is 0 percent overall.

• The extra penalty (–10) for non‐referencing of one’s own design work or external data also applies, but since every section already scored 0, the cumulative final remains 0 percent.
